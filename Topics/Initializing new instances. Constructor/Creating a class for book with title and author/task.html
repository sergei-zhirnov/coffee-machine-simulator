<div class="step-text">
<div class="alert alert-warning">Hey there! This problem might be a bit unpredictable, but give it a go and let us know how you do!</div>Imagine you are creating a Book class in Java, each book has a title and an author, and we can get its information via a method. Now, you need to write code to help with this. Firstly, you will receive a single line with a book title and an author separated by a comma ('Book Title,Author'). Create a new instance of the Book class with this information. Then, provide a method to return the information (title and author) of this book as a single string in the following format: 'Book Title by Author'.<br><b>Sample Input:</b><br><pre><code class="language-no-highlight">Moby Dick,Herman Melville</code></pre><br><b>Sample Output:</b><br><pre><code class="language-no-highlight">Moby Dick by Herman Melville</code></pre><br><br><b>Sample Input:</b><br><pre><code class="language-no-highlight">1984,George Orwell</code></pre><br><b>Sample Output:</b><br><pre><code class="language-no-highlight">1984 by George Orwell</code></pre><br><br><br><font color="gray">Memory limit: 256 MB</font><br><font color="gray">Time limit: 5 seconds</font><br><br>
