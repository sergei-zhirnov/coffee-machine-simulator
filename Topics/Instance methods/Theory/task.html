<p>As you know, a <a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/19918" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="A class in Java is a fundamental concept that serves as a blueprint for creating objects. | It defines the properties and behaviors of an object through the use of fields and methods. Fields describe the object's characteristics, while methods describe what the object can do. Classes can be divided into two categories: instance and static. Instance classes are defined using the class keyword, followed by the class name, and can have any name that does not start with a digit.">class</a> is one of the fundamental concepts in Java. You develop the logic of a program by creating <a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/11523" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="A field in Java is a variable that is declared within a class, and it is used to store data. | It can have any type, including primitive types (such as int, float, boolean, etc.) and class types (even the same class). A class can have multiple fields, and they are used to store the current state or data of the instance of the class. Fields can be accessed and modified through methods, and they are a crucial part of object-oriented programming in Java.">fields</a> and methods inside classes. Fields describe an <a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/4727" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Java, an object is an instance of a class. | It represents a real-world entity with a specific state and behavior. The state of an object is defined by the values assigned to its fields or attributes, while its behavior is defined by the methods it can execute. Objects are created on the heap and are accessed through references, which are variables that store the memory address of the object.">object</a>'s <a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/3615" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="A property in Java refers to a characteristic or attribute of an object, represented by a field within a class. | It describes the state of an object and can be accessed and modified through getter and setter methods.

They are an essential part of object-oriented programming in Java, allowing for encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.">properties</a> and methods describe what an object does. In this topic, we will go on to discuss the nature of methods in Java. All methods can be divided into two groups: <strong>instance</strong><em> </em>and<em> </em><strong>static</strong>. We were mostly focused on the static ones previously, so now let's learn more about <a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/3534" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="An instance method in Java is a type of method that is associated with a specific instance or object of a class, and can access and modify the state of that object through its instance variables. | It is defined within a class, but outside of any other method, and is invoked using the dot notation on an object reference. Instance methods can also be overridden in subclasses to provide different behavior for different types of objects.">instance methods</a> to better understand the differences between the two. </p><h5 id="whats-the-difference">What's the difference?</h5><p>Let's look at the code below. Here we have a class named <code class="language-java">Human</code> with two fields and two methods. </p><pre><code class="language-java">class Human {
    String name;
    int age;

    public static void printStatic() {
        System.out.println("It's a static method");
    }

    }
}</code></pre><p>The <a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/10982" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Java, a modifier is a keyword that provides additional information about a class, method, or field to the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). | Modifiers can indicate whether a method is static or not, which affects how it can be accessed. A static method belongs to the class and can be accessed without creating an object, while an instance method can only be invoked through or with an object of the class. The recommended order for modifiers can be found in the Java Language Specification.">modifier</a> <code class="language-java">public</code>  isn't important for us now. It just means that other classes can also get access to our methods.</p><p>As you see, the methods <code class="language-java">printStatic</code> and <code class="language-java">printInstance</code> have differences in <a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/10982" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="Declaration in Java is the process of defining a variable, method, or class by specifying its name, type, and other attributes. | When declaring a variable, you specify its data type and name, and optionally initialize it with a value. Declaring a variable with a specific type can be lengthy and difficult to read, but starting from Java 10, you can use the var keyword instead of a specific type to force automatic type inference based on the type of assigned value.">declaration</a>. When you see a method, you can easily understand: if there is a word <code class="language-java">static</code>, then the method is <strong>static</strong>; if there is no word <code class="language-java">static</code>, then the method is an <strong>instance </strong>one.</p><p>Now let's see what this really means!</p><h5 id="understanding-static-and-instance">Understanding: static and instance </h5><p>To <a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/7762" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Java, invoke means to execute a specific set of code within a method. | It involves using the method's name and providing the necessary arguments, if any. When a method is invoked, the program's control is transferred to the method's code, allowing it to perform its intended operation. Invoking a method promotes code reusability and modularity, making the code more organized, maintainable, and easier to understand.">invoke</a> a <a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/3534" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Java, static methods are class-level methods that are not associated with any specific object instance. | They are invoked using the class name and can't access non-static fields or methods directly. Static methods are often used as utility functions, providing a common functionality that doesn't depend on object state. They are typically used for operations like mathematical calculations, data formatting, or other tasks that don't require access to object-specific data. Static methods ensure code reusability and can help maintain a clean, organized code structure.">static method</a> we don't need to create an object. We just call the method with the class name.</p><pre><code class="language-java">public static void main(String[] args) {

    Human.printStatic(); // will print "It's a static method"
}
</code></pre><p>In other words, you can say that a static method belongs to a class (because we don't need an object).</p><p>An instance method requires a different <a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/7762" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Java, invocation refers to the process of calling or activating a method or function in an object or class. | It involves requesting a specific action or computation to be performed by the target method, which then returns a result or performs some side effect. This mechanism is fundamental to object-oriented programming, as it enables the creation of reusable, modular components that can be easily integrated and extended. Java supports various types of invocation, including method invocation, constructor invocation, and reflection-based invocation, each serving different purposes and following specific rules.">invocation</a>. As you already guessed, to invoke an instance method we have to create an object first. Otherwise, there is no way to use an instance method.</p><p>It's called an instance method because an instance is a concrete representation of an object.</p><p>Here we <a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/10973" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Java, call is a term used to describe the process of invoking or executing a method, constructor, or function. | This action can be initiated from within another method, constructor, or function, and it allows for the sharing and reuse of code. The call can be made using different access modifiers, such as public, private, or protected, which determine where the call can be made from. Additionally, calls can be made using various types of parameters, including primitive types, objects, and arrays, which are passed to the method, constructor, or function being called.">call</a> the method <code class="language-java">printInstance</code> for two different objects:</p><pre><code class="language-java">public static void main(String[] args) {

    Human alice =  new Human();
    alice.printInstance(); // will print "It's an instance method"
}</code></pre><p>So, we can say that an instance method is a method that belongs to each object that we created of the particular class. </p><h5 id="instance-methods-features">Instance methods: features</h5><p>Instance methods have a great advantage: they can access fields of the particular object of the class.</p><p>To illustrate the feature, let's modify our class <code class="language-java">Human</code>.

However, the use of keywords can sometimes make code less readable due to boilerplate code, hence their usage should be standardized in a project.">keyword</a> <code class="language-java">this</code> represents a particular instance of the class.</p><p>It's easier to understand by an example:</p><pre><code class="language-java">public static void main(String[] args) {

}</code></pre><p>Look, now we have different outputs for the method <code class="language-java">work</code> because two different objects have different values for <code class="language-java">name</code>.
