<h2>Objects and their properties</h2>
<div class="step-text">
<p>A typical <a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/3596" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Java, an object is an instance of a class. | It represents a real-world entity with a specific state and behavior. The state of an object is defined by the values assigned to its fields or attributes, while its behavior is defined by the methods it can execute. Objects are created on the heap and are accessed through references, which are variables that store the memory address of the object.">object</a>-oriented program consists of a set of interacting <strong>objects</strong>. Each object has its own <a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/19054" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Java, state refers to the condition or status of a thread at a given point in time. | It is represented by an enum with six possible values: NEW, RUNNABLE, BLOCKED, WAITING, TIMED_WAITING, and TERMINATED. These states reflect the different stages of a thread's life cycle, from creation to termination. The state of a thread can be obtained using an instance method.">state</a> separated from others. Each object is an <a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/3495" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Java, instance refers to an object created from a class. | It is an instance of that class, meaning it has its own unique state and behavior defined by the class. Instances are created using the new keyword followed by the class name, and they exist independently in memory, each with their own set of variables and methods. Instances can also be referred to as objects, and they are the fundamental building blocks of object-oriented programming in Java.">instance</a> of a particular <a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/19918" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="A class in Java is a fundamental concept that serves as a blueprint for creating objects. | It defines the properties and behaviors of an object through the use of fields and methods. Fields describe the object's characteristics, while methods describe what the object can do. Classes can be divided into two categories: instance and static.

<p>All classes from the standard library (<strong><code class="language-java">String</code></strong>, <strong><code class="language-java">Date</code></strong>) and classes defined by programmers are <strong>reference</strong><strong> types</strong> which means that <a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/3518" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Java, a variable is a named storage location that is used to store a value of a specific type. | It is declared with a specific data type, which determines the kind of value that can be stored in it. Every variable has a unique name, also known as an identifier, which is used to access its value. Variables can be declared and initialized in a single statement, and their values can be accessed and modified throughout the program.">variables</a> of these types store addresses where the actual objects are located. In this regard, the comparison and assignment operations work with objects differently than with primitive types.</p>
<h5 id="creating-objects" style="text-align: center;">Creating objects</h5>
<p>The keyword <strong>new</strong> creates an object of a particular class. Here we create a standard <a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/3522" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="A string in Java is a reference type consisting of characters, and it is one of the most widely used types in Java. | Strings are immutable, meaning their characters cannot be changed once created. They have methods for getting individual characters and extracting substrings, and they work with text, whether it's a simple hello, world! or a complex document. Strings are everywhere in Java code, and understanding how to use them effectively is fundamental for any Java developer.">string</a> and assign it to the variable <strong><code class="language-java">str</code></strong>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">String str = new String("hello");</code></pre>
<p>The variable <strong><code class="language-java">str</code></strong> stores a reference to the object <strong>"hello"</strong> located somewhere in the <a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/3610" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Java, heap is the region of memory where objects are stored and allocated dynamically during runtime. | It is a shared memory space among all threads in the same JVM process, allowing them to communicate through shared data. To optimize memory usage, Java uses a string pool in the heap to store strings with the same value, and object interning for certain widely-used classes. The heap's size can be managed using various JVM options, and it is an essential aspect of Java's memory management and platform independence.">heap</a> <a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/18747" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Java, memory refers to the space allocated for storing data and information used by a program during its execution. | It is a crucial aspect of programming, as it allows for the temporary storage of variables, objects, and other program elements. Java manages memory automatically through a feature called garbage collection. This process reclaims memory that is no longer being used by the program, freeing up space and improving performance. The memory in Java is divided into several regions, including the stack, heap, and method area.">memory</a>.</p>
<p>In the same way, we can create an object of any class we know.</p>
<p>Here is a class that describes a patient in a hospital information system:</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">class Patient {
    String name;
    int age;
}</code></pre>
<p>Here is an instance of this class:</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">Patient patient = new Patient();</code></pre>
<p>Despite the fact that <strong><code class="language-java">String</code></strong> is a standard class and <strong><code class="language-java">Patient</code></strong> is our own class, both classes are regular <a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/5035" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="A reference type in Java is a data type that stores the memory address of an object, allowing you to access and manipulate the object's state and behavior. | Unlike primitive types, which store their values directly, reference types store a reference to an object located elsewhere in memory. This reference can be assigned to variables, passed as arguments to methods, and returned as values from methods. Reference types are important for creating complex, object-oriented programs in Java.">reference types</a>. However, there is a big difference between those classes and we will discuss it below. </p>
<h5 id="immutability-of-objects" style="text-align: center;">Immutability of objects</h5>
<p>There is an important concept in programming called <strong><a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/13511" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Java, immutability is a concept that refers to an object's ability to always store the same value. | Once created, an immutable object cannot be changed. If we need to modify the value of an immutable object, we should create a new object instead. A common example of an immutable object is the String class, where all string operations produce a new string. This is because strings in Java are immutable, meaning they cannot be changed once created.">immutability</a></strong>. Immutability means that an object always stores the same values. If we need to modify these values, we should create a new object. A common example is the standard <strong><code class="language-java">String</code></strong> class. Strings are immutable objects so all string operations produce a new string. <a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/3575" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Java, immutable type is a type of object that, once created, cannot be modified. | The state of the object is set at creation time and remains constant throughout its lifetime. This is achieved by making all fields of the class final and ensuring that any methods that appear to modify the object actually create and return a new instance with the desired changes. Immutable types provide several benefits, including thread safety, prevention of unintended modification, and the ability to cache frequently used instances.">Immutable types</a> allow you to write programs with fewer errors.</p>
<p>The class <strong><code class="language-java">Patient</code></strong> is not immutable because it is possible to change any field of an object.</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">Patient patient = new Patient();

patient.name = "Mary";
patient.name = "Alice";</code></pre>
<p>In the following topics, we will look at the existing immutable classes as well as learn how to create new ones and when to use them.</p>
<h5 id="sharing-references" style="text-align: center;">Sharing references</h5>
<p>More than one variable can refer to the same object.</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">Patient patient = new Patient();

patient.name = "Mary";
patient.age = 24;

System.out.println(patient.name + " " + patient.age); // Mary 24

Patient p = patient;

System.out.println(p.name + " " + p.age); // Mary 24
</code></pre>
<p>It is important to understand that two variables refer to the same data in memory rather than two independent copies. Since our class is mutable, we can <a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/10982" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Java, modify refers to the act of changing the value of a variable or object. | This can be done through assignment operators, which alter the value of a variable, or by using methods or functions that change the state of an object. It's important to note that strings in Java are immutable, meaning they cannot be modified once created. Instead, a new string must be created if changes are needed. Additionally, there are modifier keywords in Java that define the visibility and behavior of methods and classes.">modify</a> the object using both references.</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">patient.age = 25;
System.out.println(p.age); // 25</code></pre>
<h5 id="nullability" style="text-align: center;">Nullability</h5>
<p>As for any reference type, a variable of a class type can be <strong><a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/9699" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Java, 'null' is a special value that represents the absence of an object or a value. | It is used to indicate that a variable does not refer to any object or that a method does not return any value. 'null' is the default value for all reference types, and it can be assigned to any variable of a reference type. However, using 'null' can lead to NullPointerExceptions, which are runtime errors that occur when you try to access a method or property of a 'null' object.">null</a></strong> which means it is not initialized yet.</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">Patient patient = null;</code></pre>
<p>This is a common feature in Java available for classes since they are reference types.</p>
<p></p><div class="alert alert-primary">Attempting to access a reference that points to <strong>null</strong> will result in an <strong>exception</strong>. It indicates that you're trying to perform an operation on a non-existent object. We'll deal with this topic in the following topics.</div>
<h5 id="conclusion" style="text-align: center;">Conclusion</h5>
<p>By now, not only have we already worked with some classes from the standard <a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/3770" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="A library in Java is a pre-written set of classes, interfaces, and methods that provide reusable functionality for developers. | It is a collection of code that can be utilized across multiple applications, saving developers time and effort. Libraries can be part of the Java Standard Library or third-party libraries. They help standardize common tasks, such as network communication, file I/O, or database access, and promote code reusability and best practices. By using libraries, developers can focus on the unique aspects of their applications, rather than reinventing the wheel.">library</a> but also learned how Java allows us to create our own classes. In this topic, we've discussed that the nature of custom classes' objects and standard library ones are based on the same principles.</p>
<p>Keep in mind, that classes defined by programmers are <strong>reference types</strong>. When objects are created by the <strong>new</strong> operator it returns a reference in memory where the created objects are located. With this reference, we can get access to fields and change them. Several variables can refer to the same object through a reference. It is also possible to create two independent objects with the same <a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/11523" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="A field in Java is a variable that is declared within a class, and it is used to store data. | It can have any type, including primitive types (such as int, float, boolean, etc.) and class types (even the same class).

It's important to understand that references to such objects are different. However, not all objects allow changing their state after creation.
