<h2>Implementing a calculator with operation history tracking</h2>
<div class="step-text">
<div class="alert alert-warning">Hey there! This problem might be a bit unpredictable, but give it a go and let us know how you do!</div>You are to implement a class named Calculator in Java. The Calculator has an instance variable 'value' which gets updated each time an operation is performed and a static variable 'history' which represents the total number of operations performed across all instances of the Calculator. Two operations can be performed on the Calculator: addition (add() method) which adds a number to 'value', and multiplication (multiply() method) which multiplies 'value' by a specific number. When an operation is called, the 'history' variable should be incremented by one. Implement a 'showHistory()' static method to show the total number of operations performed. For the initial value of 'value' which will be passed when creating a new Calculator instance, perform addition and multiplication operations (values will also be given as input) and print the final value and history.

Input: One line containing three space-separated integers First one represents initial value while next two are given for addition and multiplication operations.

Output: Two lines First line contains the final 'value' and second line contains the total number of operations performed.<br><b>Sample Input:</b><br><pre><code class="language-no-highlight">10 20 2<br></code></pre><br><b>Sample Output:</b><br><pre><code class="language-no-highlight">60<br>2<br></code></pre><br><br><br><font color="gray">Memory limit: 256 MB</font><br><font color="gray">Time limit: 5 seconds</font><br><br>
